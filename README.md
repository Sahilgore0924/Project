Project Description
The Online Quiz System is a software application used to conduct quizzes through the internet.
In this project, we analyze quiz data and display it in the form of graphs to understand student performance and system usage.

The system stores quiz-related data such as:

1)Number of quizzes attempted

2)Student registrations

3)Correct and wrong answers

3)Average score

4)Time spent on quizzes

5)Pass and fail count

Using Python, we process this data and generate visual graphs.
These graphs help administrators and teachers easily understand how students are performing and how actively the quiz system is being used.
